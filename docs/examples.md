# FlexBE Introductory Examples

In addition to the basic TurtleSim quickstart demo, this
repo includes several examples behaviors to illustrate key
FlexBE capabilities.

You are free to jump into any example, but they are designed to
get progressively more complex and take advantage of earlier
behaviors.

* [Example 1](docs/example1.md) - Basic FlexBE state implementations
* [Example 2](docs/example2.md) - Basic state machine
* [Example 3](docs/example3.md) - A HFSM behavior with concurrent states
* [Example 4](docs/example4.md) - Using behaviors in other behaviors (a 3-layer HFSM)
* [Example 5](docs/example5.md) - Priority containers
* [TurtleSim Deep Dive](docs/turtlesim_deep_dive.md) - Deep dive into `action` and `service` interfaces
